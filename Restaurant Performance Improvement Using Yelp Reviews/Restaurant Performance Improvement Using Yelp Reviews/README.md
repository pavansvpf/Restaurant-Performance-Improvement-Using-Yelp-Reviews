Restaurants have always played an role in the business, social, intellectual and artistic life of a thriving society.In the modern world this results in restaurant being an important part of economy of many countries with contributions to both to the GDP and to the employment opportunities. There is stiff competition in the restaurant industry and often a lot of restaurants struggle to keep business and close down. This project proposes to detect the restaurants which are going to close down in the near future and also provide ways to improve their business based on the features of successful restaurants. It is implemented using Yelp dataset, the checkins are used to classify the restaurants into open or closed, the reviews are used to find amenities, features, cuisines etc that a restaurant can offer to improve its business. Improving quality of restaurants increases the quality of life of the general population along with increase in GDP and employment opportunities.
